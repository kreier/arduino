# TFT display 2.4 inch 320x240

The driver chip is ILI9341 and it's best to use the Adafruit libraries specifically written for the 8bit parallel bus: https://github.com/adafruit/TFTLCD-Library

The chip is automatically detected. The displays have a touchscreen that can be addressed by the [tftpaint.ino](https://github.com/adafruit/TFTLCD-Library/blob/master/examples/tftpaint/tftpaint.ino) written back in 2014.

And it works.
